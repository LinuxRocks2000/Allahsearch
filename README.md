# Allahsearch
A parser and RegEX search tool for [youcef-mo's Okaz project](https://github.com/youcef-mo/Okaz). Made for a friend who wanted to search for specific phrases in many thousands of Islamic (and pre-Islamic, and Abbaci) poems.

There is a prebuilt Windows executable in target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release. You can also build it yourself; it's written in Rust.

Usage: call the allahsearch tool from inside the Okaz directory (submoduled in this repository, for convenience, although that _does_ require a lil' finnagling). It'll open into a nice lil' wizard.
